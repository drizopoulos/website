The current composition of my research group:

- **Sara Baart**: Sara is a post-Doc student working on extending joint models in studies with special types of designs, and in particular in case-cohort designs.

- **Nicole Erler**: Nicole is a post-Doc student working on methods for analyzing longitudinal outcomes with missing baseline and time-varying covariates. She currently also writes an R package for implementing a full Bayesian anlysis in such settings under the sequential approach. More info on her GitHub page.

- **Anja Ruten-Budde**: Anja is a post-Doc student working on combinations of joint models with machine learning techniques.

- **Pedro Manuel Miranda Afonso**: Pedro is a PhD student working on extensions of joint models for recurrent event data and spatial correlations with applications in cystic fibrosis.

- **Aglina Lika**: Aglina is a PhD student working in developing methodology and software for Bayesian multivariate mixed effects models.

- **Floor van Oudenhoven**: Floor is a PhD student working in novel applications and methodology of joint models in clinical trials. Her motivation comes from Alzheimer's disease.

- **Teun Petersen**: Teun is a PhD student working in developing new methods for personalized screening with applications in cardiology.

- **Hongchao Qi**: Hongchao is a PhD student working on extensions of power priors methodology in lonigitudinal clinical trials.

- **Zhenwei Yang**: Zhenwei is a PhD student working on applications of joint models in personalized scheduling with applications in prostate cancer research.
